# joomla-xbArticleMan
 xbArticleMan is a component to provide some additional tools for backend administration of Joomla content. It provides views for finding Images, Links, Shortcodes and Tags in, or associated with, com_content articles.

Version 2.1.0 is a major update with many minor and major improvements. Work started on it back in 2019, but it was put aside for nearly 4 years before finally being picked up again. It is still not Joomla5 compliant, although most of the code has been updated. I still run J3 sites exclusively with no plans to migrate to J5 as there is too much work invested in custom extensions for particular sites to make it worth the effort.

Currently it offers six views in the backend:

Dashboard - a summary of the counts of articles, tags, images, links and shortcodes
Articles:tags - details of the tags assigned to each article
Articles:links - shows the &lt;a ...&gt;...&lt;<&gt; tags in the content, and the related links fields for each article 
Articles:images - shows the &lt;img .../&gt;tags in the content, and the intro/full image fields for each article 
Articles: Shortcodes - lists all of the plugin shortcodes found in each article
Article Edit simplified - a simplified article edit screen which allows editing of title, alias, category, tags, and the image and link fields for an article.
